# [**[CVPR-2024] A Dual Augmentor Framework for Domain Generalization in 3D Human Pose Estimation**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11310)

### Prerequisites:
- Datasets: Please follow [**PoseAug**](https://github.com/jfzhang95/PoseAug) and [**AdaptPose**](https://github.com/mgholamikn/AdaptPose).
- Environments: Please follow [**PoseAug**](https://github.com/jfzhang95/PoseAug).
- Backbone: Here we only provide the VideoPose3D as the backbone. You can try other backbones by adding new directories in "model_baseline"
- Pretraining and Evaluation: We do not contain these parts in the repo. You can either follow previous works like [**PoseAug**](https://github.com/jfzhang95/PoseAug) and [**AdaptPose**](https://github.com/mgholamikn/AdaptPose) to implement or write it by yourself.
